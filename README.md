Social DIstancing And Face Mask Detector
(IIP PROJECT)


Project Idea: 

1) Face Mask Detection : This is a project which aims to aid the authorities in maintaining public safety measures this time by helping them differentiate between the people wearing and not wearing masks. After detection, the data of people violating the rule is also stored and a mail is also sent to the authority.
